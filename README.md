# Objective

This project begins with gathering judicial opinions from the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals from the year 2022. The 6th Circuit is the appellate court with jurisdiction over all of the federal courts in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan.

This analysis involves language processing the written court opinions from 2022 to determine predictive factors connected with the outcome of the appellee or appellant winning the appeal. The general process of an appeal in Circuit court is that the losing party in the lower federal court will file an appeal to the court and is the ‘appellant.’

The data set exists in PDF format. The 6th Circuit has all of its written judicial opinions available on its website. These are sortable by year. Downloading this data involved creating some python scripts to automate the download process as there were almost 300 PDFs for the year 2022.
